# Google Cloud Computing Foundations: Cloud Computing Fundamentals

The Google Cloud Computing Foundations courses are an introduction of cloud computing for beginners, with little or no background. 
They provide an overview of concepts central to cloud basics, big data, and machine learning, and where and how Google Cloud fits in.
I got this course from an inclusion initiative from my city's prefecture in partnership with Google.

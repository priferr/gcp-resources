Overview
In a challenge lab youâ€™re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the quest to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

This lab is recommended for students who have enrolled in the Create and Manage Cloud Resources quest. Are you ready for the challenge?

Topics tested:

Create an instance

Create a 3-node Kubernetes cluster and run a simple service

Create an HTTP(s) load balancer in front of two web servers

Setup
Before you click the Start Lab button
Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
Note: Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents any conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.
Time to complete the lab---remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
Note: If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.
How to start your lab and sign in to the Google Cloud Console
Click the Start Lab button. If you need to pay for the lab, a pop-up opens for you to select your payment method. On the left is the Lab Details panel with the following:

The Open Google Console button
Time remaining
The temporary credentials that you must use for this lab
Other information, if needed, to step through this lab
Click Open Google Console. The lab spins up resources, and then opens another tab that shows the Sign in page.

Tip: Arrange the tabs in separate windows, side-by-side.

Note: If you see the Choose an account dialog, click Use Another Account.
If necessary, copy the Username from the Lab Details panel and paste it into the Sign in dialog. Click Next.

Copy the Password from the Lab Details panel and paste it into the Welcome dialog. Click Next.

Important: You must use the credentials from the left panel. Do not use your Google Cloud Skills Boost credentials.
Note: Using your own Google Cloud account for this lab may incur extra charges.
Click through the subsequent pages:

Accept the terms and conditions.
Do not add recovery options or two-factor authentication (because this is a temporary account).
Do not sign up for free trials.
After a few moments, the Cloud Console opens in this tab.

Note: You can view the menu with a list of Google Cloud Products and Services by clicking the Navigation menu at the top-left. Navigation menu icon
Challenge scenario
You have started a new role as a Junior Cloud Engineer for Jooli, Inc. You are expected to help manage the infrastructure at Jooli. Common tasks include provisioning resources for projects.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so step-by-step guides are not provided.

Some Jooli, Inc. standards you should follow:

Create all resources in the default region or zone, unless otherwise directed.

Naming normally uses the format team-resource; for example, an instance could be named nucleus-webserver1.

Allocate cost-effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored, and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so plan carefully. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share: unless directed, use f1-micro for small Linux VMs, and use n1-standard-1 for Windows or other applications, such as Kubernetes nodes.

Your challenge
As soon as you sit down at your desk and open your new laptop, you receive several requests from the Nucleus team. Read through each description, and then create the resources.

Task 1. Create a project jumphost instance
You will use this instance to perform maintenance for the project.

Requirements:

Name the instance Instance name.
Use an f1-micro machine type.
Use the default image type (Debian Linux).
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.
Create a project jumphost instance

Task 2. Create a Kubernetes service cluster
Note: There is a limit to the resources you are allowed to create in your project. If you don't get the result you expected, delete the cluster before you create another cluster. If you don't, the lab might end and you might be blocked. To get your account unblocked, you will have to reach out to Google Cloud Skills Boost Support.
The team is building an application that will use a service running on Kubernetes. You need to:

Create a zonal cluster using <filled in at lab start>.
Use the Docker container hello-app (gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0) as a placeholder; the team will replace the container with their own work later.
Expose the app on port App port number.
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.
Create a Kubernetes cluster

Task 3. Set up an HTTP load balancer
You will serve the site via nginx web servers, but you want to ensure that the environment is fault-tolerant. Create an HTTP load balancer with a managed instance group of 2 nginx web servers. Use the following code to configure the web servers; the team will replace this with their own configuration later.

Note: There is a limit to the resources you are allowed to create in your project, so do not create more than 2 instances in your managed instance group. If you do, the lab might end and you might be banned.
cat << EOF > startup.sh
#! /bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y nginx
service nginx start
sed -i -- 's/nginx/Google Cloud Platform - '"\$HOSTNAME"'/' /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
EOF
Copied!
You need to:

Create an instance template.
Create a target pool.
Create a managed instance group.
Create a firewall rule named as Firewall rule to allow traffic (80/tcp).
Create a health check.
Create a backend service, and attach the managed instance group with named port (http:80).
Create a URL map, and target the HTTP proxy to route requests to your URL map.
Create a forwarding rule.
Click Check my progress to verify the objective.
Create the website behind the HTTP load balancer

Congratulations!
You learned how to create and manage Cloud resources.
